Q1.) Git is useful for version control and making sure your work is located in a safeplace. If you might lose your work locally, Git saves the last working copy pushed onto the repository, allowing for easy backup.

Q2.) Data Science can be applied to many different fields, for example one of them being machine learning and prediction models. Understanding data - how it is formatted and how to work with an accumulation of a lot of data - is useful in fields like machine learning as you are able to give your program/machine data to learn from and influence its next acts.

Q3.) Merging preserves the history of the files to merge, however rebasing overwrites the commit history.

Q4.) This semester I am looking forward to learning about Data Science and Machine Learning and understanding how to apply the lessons learned from class into real-world situations.
